## Database Schema Considerations

```json
{
  "rooms": {
    "roomPin": {
      "players": {},
      "gameState": {},
      "fogOfWar": {
        "player1Explored": {},
        "player2Explored": {}
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Design Firebase architecture that supports real-time gameplay while maintaining data consistency, security, and efficient fog of war state management.
