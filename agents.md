## Agent Usage Guide

### Automatic Invocation
Claude Code will automatically delegate tasks to the appropriate expert based on context:

```bash
# These queries will automatically invoke the right expert:
"Set up the game canvas and rendering system" → canvas-game-engine
"Create the WebSocket server for multiplayer" → websocket-multiplayer
"Implement tank movement mechanics" → battle-city-mechanics
"Set up Firebase database for matches" → firebase-backend
"Create tank animation sequences" → sprite-animation
"Add sound effects for shooting" → audio-system
"Plan the development workflow and coordinate agents" → project-orchestrator
Explicit Invocation
You can also call experts directly when needed:
bash# Explicit expert invocation

Getting Started with Project Orchestrator
Start any development session with the project orchestrator to get proper planning:
bash# Initial project setup
> Use project-orchestrator to analyze the current project state and create a development plan

# Feature implementation
