Core Mechanics
Movement & Controls

Grid-based Movement: 13x13 tile battlefield
4-directional: No diagonal movement (authentic to original)
Controls: Arrow keys (movement) + Spacebar (shoot)
Speed: Consistent across all player tanks
Collision: Solid terrain blocks, water impassable, trees provide concealment
Exploration: 3-tile radius vision around tank reveals map permanently

Combat System

Bullet System: 1 bullet per player (upgradeable to 2 with 3-star power-up)
Friendly Fire: Enabled but only causes 0.5s stun (prevents griefing)
Damage: Single-hit destruction for players
Respawn: 3s delay + 1.2s invulnerability period
Shooting Cooldown: Prevents bullet spam

Power-up System

Spawn Trigger: Every 4th, 11th, and 18th global kill across all players
Location: Random spawn in 16 predefined central positions (may be in unexplored areas)
Duration: Temporary effects with visual timers
Exploration Risk: Power-ups in fog of war create strategic exploration decisions
Types:

Star: Upgrade tank level (faster bullets → dual bullets → steel-piercing)
Helmet: Temporary invulnerability
Grenade: Destroy all enemy units on screen
Shovel: Reinforce own eagle with steel walls (15s duration)
Tank: Extra life (respawn tokens)
Timer: Freeze all enemies temporarily

Terrain & Environment
Tile Types

Brick: Destructible, blocks bullets and tanks (4 hits to destroy, 2 with max power)
Steel: Indestructible except by max-power bullets (2 hits from same side)
Forest: Concealment for tanks and bullets (no collision)
Water: Impassable for tanks, bullets pass through
Ice: Low friction, tanks slide on deceleration

Map Design Philosophy

Symmetrical: Fair starting positions and layout
Strategic Depth: Multiple routes, choke points, and power-up control areas
Eagle Protection: Initial brick barriers around eagle bases
