## Development Team - Specialized Agents

The project includes a team of 7 specialized Claude agents for efficient development coordination:

### üéÆ Core Development Agents
- **`canvas-game-engine`** - HTML5 Canvas rendering, sprite systems, game loops
- **`websocket-multiplayer`** - Real-time networking, matchmaking, state sync
- **`battle-city-mechanics`** - Game logic, combat rules, fog of war mechanics
- **`firebase-backend`** - Database design, cloud functions, persistence

### üé® Content & Experience Agents  
- **`sprite-animation`** - Animation systems, visual effects, pixel art
- **`audio-system`** - Web Audio API, sound effects, spatial audio

### üèóÔ∏è Project Management
- **`project-orchestrator`** - Task coordination, workflow planning, agent management

**Usage**: These agents can be invoked automatically by Claude Code based on context, or explicitly called for specialized tasks. The project-orchestrator coordinates complex multi-agent features and ensures architectural consistency across the development team.
